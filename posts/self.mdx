self is a virtual machine. another one? well. it's a virtual machine with an 
architecture with native AI instructions. allowing things like this: 

<br/>
<br/>

```swift
import ai

fn exec_action(item) {
    println("executing action: ", item)
    item.exec()
}

let actions = ai.do("
create a file called demo.txt 
and put the content 'hello world!' on it
")

actions.map(exec_action)
```

<br/>
<br/>

```
import ai

let input = "admin@admin.admin"
if ai.infer("does <arg> input looks like a sql injection?", input) {
  println("warning!")
} else {
  println("secure!")
}
```
